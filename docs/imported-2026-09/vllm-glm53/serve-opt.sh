# Serve GLM-5.3-Flash (NVFP4) on a single RTX PRO 6000 (96 GB).
#
# HOW THIS FITS ON ONE CARD
# The checkpoint is 181.3 GiB, but 163.3 GiB of that (90%) is routed MoE expert
# weights. --cpu-offload-params experts keeps those in pinned host RAM and lets
# the GPU read them over PCIe via UVA; everything else -- attention, embeddings,
# the shared expert, norms -- is only 18.0 GiB and stays resident.
#
# Because it is a top-8-of-288 MoE, a decode step touches only 8/288 of each
# layer's expert bytes, so zero-copy UVA reads what is actually routed. That is
# why the *uva* backend is right here and the *prefetch* backend is not: prefetch
# moves whole layers ahead of time (~3.9 GiB/layer) regardless of routing.
#
# WHY THE OFFLOAD IS THIS LARGE
# It is not a preference. 95.6 GiB of VRAM minus 18.0 GiB of resident weights
# minus KV/activations leaves room for ~60-65 GiB of experts, so ~100 GiB must
# live on the host: CPU_OFFLOAD_GB below that OOMs at load. Going ABOVE the
# floor is what we actually want -- see "the measured-best configuration".
#
# Needs Glm5Next support from vLLM PR #53906 -- not in any released vLLM.
#
# Unlike the Qwen3.8-Flash-Next launcher, this needs NO sudo: UVA offload is
# in-process pinned memory, with none of the CUDA-IPC/pidfd_getfd handoff that
# forced ptrace_scope=0 there.

# These four knobs are a MATCHED SET, not independent preferences. Changing one

#
#   offload 125 + 68 hot slots   16.76 tok/s   <- default below
#   offload 105, no pinning      13.73 tok/s   (the old default)
#   offload 125, no pinning      11.34 tok/s   (more traffic, nothing to absorb)
#
# Offloading MORE is faster only because the VRAM it frees funds the hot-expert
# cache, and the hottest 36% of a layer's experts serve 75% of its fetches. Take
# the cache away and 125 is the worst of the three. That is why the old header
# advice ("above ~100 just costs speed") no longer holds -- it was written
# before pinning existed.

# so a profile captured at a different offload describes different layers.

# KV_BYTES is explicit and weights+cache are fixed, so the only slack is here.

#   54 slots / 6.2 GiB free -> 304,800 tokens prefill fine (205 s, 1487 tok/s)
# Going further down to 48 buys nothing: decode 14.92 vs 14.99 tok/s, inside the
# +-1 tok/s run-to-run spread, because 48->54 is only ~3 points of cache hit rate.
